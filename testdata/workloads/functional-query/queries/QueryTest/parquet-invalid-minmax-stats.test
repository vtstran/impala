# IMPALA-6527, IMPALA-6538: NaN values lead to incorrect filtering.
# When the first value is NaN in a column chunk, Impala might choose it as min_value and
# max_value for statistics. In this case the min/max filter should be ignored.
# 'min_max_is_nan' is written by an old writer, therefore it contains invalid statistics.
